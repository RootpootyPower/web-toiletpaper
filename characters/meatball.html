		<p class="desc">Meatball is an unequivocal misogynist. He seems to be so stuck in his ways and this is the very reason he has no friends. Magnet is his anchor and has the “I can fix him” mentality. Magnet wants to help Meatball improve as a person, but for some reason he just can't change. As a descendant of Jesus Christ his opinion doesn't matter. According to everyone else, that is. But hey, he's strong at least.</p>
