    <p>FUCK YOU PARAMOUNT GLOBAL!! YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHOW!!!! In public. I separate my private autism from my public autism.<br><br>P.S: We will not accept any requests to bring Toilet Paper to your networks or streaming platforms. Nor will we accept offers to have you distribute Toilet Paper physically through Paramount Home Entertainment. Shout! Factory should have that covered if they're interested.
