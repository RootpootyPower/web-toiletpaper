  <h2>NEW ICONS!!!</h2>
  <h3>Posted <span class="date">Jan. 2, 2026, 7:22 PM EST</span></h3>

    <p>Violet finally finished the topnav icons, so the website is approximately 15% more colourful. There's also a French translation of the website now, if you're into that sort of thing.

    In show-related news, we're gonna be trying to finish NHSR soon. Or at least I am. If you don't know what the hell that means, then good. If you do you're either part of the team or someone leaked it and we need their name for... a fun surprise. Please tell us.</p>
