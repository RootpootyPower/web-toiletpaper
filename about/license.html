  <h3>Policies for Derivative Works</h3>  

<p>Rootpooty Power! has enforced a complete prohibition of derivative works which contain <b>any amount of content provided by Generative AI services, either directly trained off of our works or off of other non-public works. This is non-negotiable.</b> Any infringing works will be taken down swiftly, without regards to the individual(s) responsible for it.</p>

<p>Violators of these Licensing Details will first be <b>warned</b> of their infringement. Failure to respond to communications within 14 days will result in further action being taken, once proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the author of a derivative is able to communicate. The most likely action will be a takedown request issued to the host of the derivative. Repeat offenders will have communications escalated once it poses a substantial threat to the integrity of Toilet Paper Production Team or Rootpooty Power!</p>

<p>In the event of a lack of attribution, actions will not escalate beyond repeat reminders of the importance of attribution. Commercial works are subject to sterner communication, especially if they do not attempt to separate themselves from Toilet Paper Production Team or Rootpooty Power!.</p><br>
