  <p class="desc">
    Toilet Paper is an animated competition show which stars 12 object-based contestants and 2 Unicode-based hosts, named T and P. The show is targeted towards a TV-MA audience, and is made explicitly clear during the beginning of every episode that the contents of the series are not intended for children.

    The contestants, who all were recently forced to relocate to a nearby plains, were 'visited' by T and P. They offered the contestants an opportunity of a lifetime! Now, the contestants are all competing on a Leapster-made island known as Eris, created through passion by T. Keep your eyes peeled to find out what happens next!
