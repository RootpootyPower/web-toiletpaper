  <h1>What is Toilet Paper?</h1>
  <h2>Written by <span class="vc">violetcassette</span></h2>
    
  <p class="desc">Toilet Paper is an animated competition show which stars 12 object-based contestants and 2 Unicode-based hosts, named T and P. The show is targeted towards a TV-MA audience, and is made explicitly clear during the beginning of every episode that the contents of the series are not intended for children. <br><br>For a detailed overview of the series' humor and potentially objectionable content, see this video. [Video has not been created yet, check back later as development on the series continues.] <br><br> The contestants, which all originated in Ohio, have since moved to a closeby plains only referred to as "the Mainland", that is... until T and P came. They offered the contestants an opportunity of a lifetime! Now, the contestants are all competing on a Leapster-made island known as Eris, created through passion by T.
